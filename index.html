			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Steve Job's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>1955</b> - On February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Steven Jobs was born and later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. Growing up alongside his sister, Patty, in the care of Paul Jobs, a skilled machinist who had a passion for fixing cars as a hobby.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1972</b> - Following his high school graduation in 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. However, his college journey was short-lived as he decided to leave after just one semester. Instead, he embarked on a transformative experience by traveling to India in the summer of 1974 to delve into the study of Eastern religions.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1975</b> - In 1975, Jobs became part of the Homebrew Computer Club, where he connected with fellow enthusiasts, including the highly skilled Steve Wozniak. Wozniak, with his technical expertise, was in the process of constructing a computer. Jobs and Wozniak actively participated in the club's gatherings during that year, which played a pivotal role in laying the groundwork for the creation and eventual commercialization of the inaugural Apple computer.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1976</b> - In 1976, Jobs and Wozniak established their independent venture, naming it Apple Computer Company as a tribute to Jobs' joyful memories of apple-picking during a past summer. To initiate their venture, they gathered $1,300 in initial capital by selling Jobs' microbus and Wozniak's calculator. Initially, they focused on selling circuit boards, the crucial components housing a computer's internal elements, as they concurrently dedicated their efforts to developing the prototype of their computer.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1984</b> - In 1984, Apple unveiled a groundbreaking computer model, the Macintosh. This innovative system featured an on-screen interface adorned with small graphical symbols called icons. Users interacted with the computer by pointing at these icons and clicking a button using a novel device known as a mouse, simplifying the user experience significantly. Despite its user-friendly design, the Macintosh struggled to gain traction in the business sector. Its limited success in the corporate world was due to the absence of certain features present in other personal computers, notably a high-quality accompanying printer.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1985</b> - The lackluster reception of the Macintosh marked the start of Jobs' decline within Apple. In 1985, he made the decision to resign from the company he had co-founded, although he retained his position as the chairman of its board of directors.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1986</b> - However, NeXT did not mark the culmination of Steve Jobs' entrepreneurial journey. In 1986, Jobs made a significant acquisition by purchasing Pixar, a small company renowned for its expertise in computer animation, from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–). This strategic move eventually led to remarkable achievements. Nine years later, Pixar achieved phenomenal success with the release of Toy Story, a major box office sensation. Following this triumph, Pixar continued to create impactful films such as Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, both of which were distributed by Disney. These movies became immensely popular, contributing to Pixar's reputation as a leading animation studio. Notably, Monsters, Inc. shattered records by securing the largest opening weekend ticket sales in the history of animated films. These accomplishments showcased Jobs' enduring entrepreneurial spirit and keen eye for innovative projects.</li>
				<br>
                <li><b>1988</b> - Shortly after leaving Apple, Jobs recruited some of his former colleagues to establish a new computer venture named NeXT. In late 1988, the NeXT computer made its debut at a grand event in San Francisco, primarily targeting the educational market. Initial responses were positive, praising its user-friendly interface, rapid processing capabilities, impressive graphics displays, and exceptional sound system. Despite the favorable reception, the NeXT machine failed to gain widespread popularity due to its high cost, monochromatic display, and lack of compatibility with other computers and common software applications.</li>
                <br>
				<li><b>1996</b> - In a February 1996 article featured in Time magazine, Jobs expressed his unwavering determination: "What propels me and my colleagues is the allure of a compelling vision, something that might seem just out of reach, yet we believe, often instinctively, is attainable. It's a pursuit worth dedicating years of our lives to bring into existence." Jobs tirelessly channeled this drive into transforming his ideas into groundbreaking products for both businesses and consumers, marking him as a true visionary in the computer industry.In a significant move, Apple acquired NeXT Software for a substantial sum exceeding $400 million in December 1996. Following this acquisition, Jobs re-entered Apple as a part-time consultant to the CEO. The subsequent year witnessed a surprising turn of events when Apple forged an unexpected partnership with its competitor, Microsoft. According to reports from The New York Times, the companies collaborated on various sales and technology initiatives. Over the ensuing six years, Apple introduced a series of new products and innovative marketing strategies, shaping the trajectory of the company in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1997</b> - In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the Internet and by telephone. The Apple Store became a runaway success. Within a week it was the third-largest e-commerce site on the Internet. In September of 1997 Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple.<br>
					In 1998 Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an affordable price. The iBook was unveiled in July 1999. This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It includes Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the cordless phone that would allow the user to surf the Internet wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs unveiled Apple's new Internet strategy. It included a group of Macintosh-only Internet-based applications. Jobs also announced that he was becoming the permanent CEO of Apple.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2005</b> - In 2005, Steve Jobs and his team at Apple embarked on the development of the inaugural iPhone, which eventually hit the market on June 29, 2007. The iPhone's launch generated such fervor that a survey revealed six out of every ten Americans were cognizant of its introduction. Time magazine even crowned it the "Invention of the Year" for 2007, underscoring the device's profound impact and widespread recognition.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2011</b> - On October 5, 2011, at approximately 3 p.m. (PDT), Steve Jobs passed away at his residence in Palo Alto, California. His death resulted from complications arising from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, ultimately leading to respiratory arrest. Jobs had slipped into unconsciousness the day before and, surrounded by his wife, children, and sisters, he breathed his last moments. His sister, Mona Simpson, shared a poignant account of his final hours, noting that Jobs' last words were simple yet profound: "Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow." Following his passing, a private funeral service was conducted on October 7, 2011, respecting the privacy and wishes of the Jobs family.</li>

			<p class="font"><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money... There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not what they're about."</i>
